# Predicting-Life-Expectancy-for-Liver-Cirrhosis-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This study investigates how various machine learning methods can be used to predict life expectancy in people with liver cirrhosis.

ABSTRACT:
This Study looks at how different machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate life expectancy in individuals with liver cirrhosis. Using a dataset with 418 occurrences and 21 attributes, the study compares the efficiency of Linear Regression, Multi-Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) methods. When the accuracy of each model is evaluated, it is discovered that the Decision Tree algorithm has the best efficiency (87.73%), which is followed by the linear regression method (79.93%), Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm (73.80%), SVM (72.39%), and the random forest algorithm (71.16%). The dissertation also uses Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis and the Cox-Hazard Proportional Method to determine the recovery time from liver cirrhosis and shows that the risk of liver cirrhosis reduces after 3000 days. The study emphasizes the predictive power of machine learning approaches and its consequences for public health and policy.

CRITICAL EVALUATION AND CONCLUSION:

Critical Evaluation:
This dissertation used various machine learning approaches to predict life expectancy according to features presented. When the performance of each model was executed, the Decision Tree model came out on top with 87.73% accuracy. Accuracy rates for linear Regression, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest methods were 79.93%, 73.80%, 72.39%, and 71.16%, correspondingly. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival and the Cox-Hazard Proportional Method were employed in the study to analyze the recovery period for individuals having liver cirrhosis, and the ROC curve obtained from the Log-Rank test revealed that the medication was effective after 3000 days. 

Experience and Knowledge Acquired:
Moreover, from this dissertation, I have gained knowledge of how the research must be done and reviewing literature on different aspects. I have acquired a better knowledge in R-Programming and Machine Learning techniques which helps me to achieve my goals in future. Also, the survival analysis methods (Kaplan-Meier and Cox-Proportional methods) are very useful which I learned from doing this dissertation. I have also acquired knowledge about the stages, causes, symptoms, and diagnostics methods of Liver cirrhosis which is useful for health and policy for public consequences.

Future Studies and Scope:
In Future studies, these methods can be further used to make a positive performance with better efficiency by tuning and scaling into different intercepts and different methods in machine learning also will be used to gain better efficiency. It can also aid with medical research by finding significant characteristics that impact life expectancy in patients with liver cirrhosis, ultimately enhancing patients results and the standard of care.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this dissertation used various machine learning approaches to predict life expectancy according to features presented. Further optimization and fine-tuning of the models may be necessary to increase their performance. Furthermore, these findings highlight the predictive power of various machine learning algorithms, the consequences for health and policy for the public decisions.
